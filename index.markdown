This website aims to present coding challenges for readers willing to prepare for professional coding interviews. For each challenge, a solution is explained and its implementation is presented to allow the reader to compare his or her solution. Mostly, the solutions are implemented in *JavaScript* using, when possible, the functional programming principles (FP). In most cases, the solution logic is language agnostic meaning that the code can easily be translated to another programming language. The challenges are designed to be interactive and aim to simulate the evaluation procedures used by corporations. The simulation covers topics such as *Code Writing*, *Code Comprehension* and *Code Completion*.
