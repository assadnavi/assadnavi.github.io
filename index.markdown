This website aims to present code challenges for readers willing to prepare for professional coding interviews. For each challenge, a solution is explained and its implementation is presented to allow the reader to compare his or her solution. Mostly, the solutions are implemented in *JavaScript* using, when possible, the functional programming principles (FP). In most cases, the solution logic is language agnostic meaning that the code can easily be translated to another programming language. The challenges aim to simulate the evaluation procedures used by corporations in coding interviews. The evaluation methods covered are *Code Writing*, *Code Comprehension* and *Code Completion*. See below the challenges.
